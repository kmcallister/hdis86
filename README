hdis86 is a Haskell interface to the udis86 disassembler, which decodes machine
code for 16-, 32-, and 64-bit x86 and x86-64 / AMD64 processors.  Most of the
documentation is provided in the form of Haddock-generated HTML, which can be
produced by running

  $ cabal configure && cabal haddock --hyperlink-source
